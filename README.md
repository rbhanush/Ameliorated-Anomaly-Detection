# Ameliorated-Anomaly-Detection
Machine Leaning Project

It contains various machine learning algorithms that has been implemented on 2 datasets(Breast Cancer dataset and KDD Cup dataset).
Some codes are written in Python and some are written in Matlab.
Proper pre-processing of datasets is performed before performing analysis.
Varios performance metric results are generated for better understanding of Outliers/Anomalies.
